# Contour Task Matrix

Use this file to decompose approved analysis into contour-specific execution tasks.

## Rules

- one row per task
- one task owns one contour
- one `block_delivery` row represents one integrated deliverable and acts as the parent for child implementation rows
- cross-contour work is split into linked tasks
- dependencies must reference the upstream task names or issue IDs explicitly
- deploy and e2e work are separate rows, not hidden inside implementation rows
- child implementation rows must reference their parent block task explicitly
- rows may depend on a specific bounded `system_analysis` slice and should name that slice explicitly when it is not the only analysis issue for the initiative
- when implementation is blocked by missing specification, record a linked `system_analysis` follow-up row or issue with explicit clarification scope
