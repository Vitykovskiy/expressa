# Workflow

## Operating Model

The repository uses a two-mode workflow tracked by `.ai-dev-template.workflow-state.json`.

Allowed `current_stage` values:

1. `setup`
2. `issue_driven`

`setup` is the only repository-wide stage. After setup completes, the repository switches to `issue_driven` and all routing is performed through GitHub Issues, dependencies, owner contours, block-level delivery tasks, and GitHub Project state.

`issue_driven` must not start from an empty backlog. Setup seeds the first `initiative` plus the first `system_analysis` issue before the repository leaves `setup`.

## Bootstrap State Rule

`.ai-dev-template.workflow-state.json` is the bootstrap guardrail that records the repository mode and the setup-to-operations transition.

Rules:

- read the file at the start of every session;
- use `current_stage` exactly as written;
- switch from `setup` to `issue_driven` only when setup exit conditions are complete;
- `current_stage` accepts exactly two repository-wide values: `setup` and `issue_driven`;
- in `issue_driven`, route work from GitHub task metadata, dependencies, owner contours, and GitHub Project state.

## Git Delivery Rule

Before starting task work, sync Git state and confirm the current working branch is based on the latest remote state of its parent branch.

After creating a commit, sync again and confirm the branch still grows from the latest working branch state before further changes, handoff, or PR creation.

Every completed task handoff must have repository-persisted evidence and verified operational side effects:

- commit all repository changes required for the completed task output;
- push the commit before considering the task handoff complete;
- if `pull_requests.enabled = true`, follow the configured PR policy after pushing;
- if `pull_requests.enabled = false`, push directly to the assigned working branch;
- verify the push and any required GitHub side effects before reporting completion;
- keep completed task outputs in the repository worktree as committed, pushed evidence;
- pair GitHub-side changes with corresponding canonical repository document updates, commits, and pushes.

If the branch is behind, diverged, or based on an outdated parent, reconcile branch history first and only then continue the workflow task.

## Text Encoding Rule

Workflow text exchanged through repository files or external delivery tools must use explicit UTF-8 encoding.

Rules:

- use UTF-8 for markdown, templates, issue bodies, PR bodies, commit-message files, and other workflow text artifacts;
- on Windows or in PowerShell, use explicit UTF-8 encoding when a file may contain non-ASCII text;
- when writing temporary files for `gh`, `git`, or related tools, encode them explicitly as UTF-8, preferably without BOM;
- if a GitHub-side artifact or repository text shows mojibake or replacement characters, rewrite the source file in explicit UTF-8 and repeat the operation with corrected text.

## Task Types

All post-setup work must be represented by GitHub Issues with one of these task types:

| Task type | Primary owner contour | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `initiative` | `system-analyst` | top-level business outcome and decomposition anchor |
| `system_analysis` | `system-analyst` | produce the canonical specification package for one bounded analysis slice, plus the related block-level decomposition and child implementation plan |
| `block_delivery` | `system-analyst` or delivery owner defined by repository policy | parent issue for one integrated deliverable that waits for all required child implementation tasks and later block-level validation |
| `implementation` | one of `frontend`, `backend`, `devops`, `qa-e2e` | execute one contour-owned child task within a block-level deliverable |
| `deploy` | `devops` | roll validated build outputs into the target environment |
| `e2e` | `qa-e2e` | validate the integrated system against scenarios and acceptance criteria |

## Mandatory Task Attributes

Each operational issue must carry these attributes through issue fields, labels, or body sections:

- `task_type`
- `owner_contour`
- `parent_initiative`
- `parent_block_task` for child implementation issues
- `depends_on`
- `definition_of_ready`
- `definition_of_done`
- `canonical_inputs`
- `project_status`

Attribute rules:

- `owner_contour` must contain exactly one contour;
- `depends_on` must list all blocking tasks explicitly or say `none`;
- `definition_of_ready` must state the preconditions for starting;
- `definition_of_done` must state the evidence needed for closure;
- `canonical_inputs` must point to repository artifacts or prerequisite tasks;
- `project_status` must match the GitHub Project item state.

Hierarchy rules:

- setup seeds exactly one initial `system_analysis` issue to start a new delivery stream;
- that initial `system_analysis` issue may later create additional bounded `system_analysis` follow-ups for the same initiative or version stream;
- each `system_analysis` issue must declare a bounded scope before creating downstream work;
- `system_analysis` creates one or more `block_delivery` parent issues only for the slice it fully specifies;
- each `block_delivery` issue owns all required child implementation issues for that integrated outcome;
- `qa-e2e` validates the `block_delivery` issue after all required child implementation issues are done;
- if implementation is blocked by missing specification, create a linked follow-up `system_analysis` issue that defines the missing requirements explicitly.

## System Analysis Decomposition

`system_analysis` is canonical by scope, not by issue size.

Approved decomposition patterns:

- version slice: one issue covers one release increment, milestone, or rollout slice;
- capability slice: one issue covers one bounded business or technical capability;
- follow-up clarification slice: one issue closes a specific specification gap discovered after downstream work starts.

Decomposition rules:

- each `system_analysis` issue must state its bounded scope in the issue body and canonical docs;
- a bounded scope must be small enough to review without requiring the full initiative context in one session;
- downstream `block_delivery`, `implementation`, `deploy`, and `e2e` tasks may be created only for the slice whose specifications are implementation-ready;
- unresolved work outside that slice must remain in another planned or follow-up `system_analysis` issue, not hidden inside the current one;
- multiple `system_analysis` issues may exist for the same initiative when their boundaries and dependencies are explicit;
- no `block_delivery` issue may depend on unspecified behavior that belongs to another undeclared analysis slice.

## GitHub Project Model

GitHub Project is the canonical execution-status board for post-setup work.

Minimum required fields:

- `Status`
- `Task Type`
- `Owner Contour`
- `Priority`

Minimum required statuses:

- `Inbox`
- `Ready`
- `In Progress`
- `Blocked`
- `Waiting for Testing`
- `Testing`
- `Waiting for Fix`
- `In Review`
- `Done`

Status semantics:

- `Inbox`: created but not yet decomposed or triaged.
- `Ready`: owner contour may start because dependencies are closed and inputs are sufficient.
- `In Progress`: the owning contour is actively executing the task.
- `Blocked`: work pauses while a dependency, access issue, or missing specification is being resolved.
- `Waiting for Testing`: a block-level delivery task has all required child implementation tasks done and is ready for integrated validation.
- `Testing`: `qa-e2e` is actively validating the integrated block-level result.
- `Waiting for Fix`: integrated validation found defects and the block-level task is waiting for child implementation follow-up.
- `In Review`: implementation is complete and the configured review or verification step is pending.
- `Done`: all done conditions are satisfied and the issue may be closed.

## Active Issue Signal

The canonical active-task marker is the GitHub Issue label `session: active`.

Rules:

- at most one open issue may carry `session: active` at a time;
- if exactly one open issue carries `session: active`, that issue is the active issue for the session;
- if multiple open issues carry `session: active`, stop and report a blocker;
- if no open issue carries `session: active`, select one eligible issue automatically, apply `session: active`, and then proceed;
- `Status` in GitHub Project is not the active-session signal by itself.

Eligibility and tie-breaking:

1. consider only open issues that have the required workflow metadata and whose declared dependencies are done;
2. prefer eligible issues with GitHub Project status `In Progress`;
3. if no eligible `In Progress` issue exists, consider eligible issues with status `Ready`;
4. within the chosen status bucket, rank by `priority: high`, then `priority: medium`, then `priority: low`, then no priority label;
5. if multiple eligible issues still remain, choose the lowest issue number.

Session handoff rule:

- add `session: active` to the selected issue before execution starts;
- remove `session: active` when work is handed off, blocked, or completed and another issue becomes active.

## Routing Algorithm

Every session must follow this sequence:

1. Start with `AGENTS.md`.
2. Read `.ai-dev-template.workflow-state.json`.
3. If `current_stage = "setup"`, execute setup instructions only.
4. If `current_stage = "issue_driven"`, select the active GitHub Issue using the `session: active` rules.
5. Read the task metadata and determine `task_type`, `owner_contour`, dependencies, and `project_status`.
6. Stop unless the owner contour matches the session role and all dependencies are closed.
7. Read only the canonical artifacts and instructions allowed for that task type and contour.
8. If the task is `implementation`, rely on task-linked inputs first and stop if they are insufficient.
9. If the task is `block_delivery` in `Waiting for Testing` or `Testing`, validate the integrated result against its integrated acceptance expectations.
10. Produce only the output owned by that task.

After the session role is identified and its role file is read, the agent must adopt that file's `Execution Profile` section as the active role prompt for the remainder of the task.

## Setup Exit Conditions

Goal:
prepare the repository, workflow, and GitHub operating model.

Mandatory completion conditions:

- `.ai-dev-template.config.json` has been read and applied to the repository workflow assets and instructions;
- if `.ai-dev-template.config.json` was modified before or during setup and its contents were used, that file is committed and pushed as part of the setup evidence unless an explicit documented exception applies;
- the repository is connected to GitHub Issues;
- the repository is connected to a GitHub Project when `project_tracking = github_project`;
- the project used for setup is linked to the current repository, not merely visible under the same owner account or organization;
- the GitHub Project exists, is reachable, and its URL plus validation status are recorded in `docs/09-integrations.md`;
- if no repository-linked GitHub Project existed before setup, setup created one, linked the repository, and applied the required fields and statuses;
- setup executed the required GitHub bootstrap actions directly and verified the resulting labels, project fields, board view, and seeded backlog;
- setup created or verified the `session: active` label used to mark the active issue;
- setup created or verified the initial seeded backlog, including at least one open `initiative` issue and exactly one open initial `system_analysis` issue;
- the initial `system_analysis` issue is marked with `session: active` before the repository enters `issue_driven`;
- required GitHub workflow infrastructure for the configured process is prepared during setup, including project fields, labels, and issue templates needed by later tasks;
- setup-side changes to instructions, docs, labels, project structure, or repository workflow assets are verified and recorded before setup exit;
- the repository has a top-level initiating Epic template or documented creation path.

Blocker handling during setup:

- when environment or permission blockers prevent GitHub-side setup, report the blocker immediately instead of working around it with unrequested bootstrap tooling;
- keep the repository in `setup` until the blocker is resolved.

Bootstrap transition:
update `current_stage` from `setup` to `issue_driven` when setup is complete.

## Task Readiness And Completion Rules

### Initiative

Ready when:

- setup is complete;
- the triggering request exists;
- no higher-level initiative already covers the same outcome.

Done when:

- child tasks for business analysis, system analysis, block delivery, implementation, deploy, and e2e are created or explicitly ruled out;
- dependency links between those tasks are recorded;
- the GitHub Project reflects the planned execution chain.

### Business Analysis

Ready when:

- an initiative exists;
- the request, requester, and expected business outcome are identifiable.

Done when:

- users, scenarios, scope, constraints, and success expectations are documented;
- unresolved business questions are recorded explicitly;
- workflow terminology and operating states are normalized for the initiative;
- exactly one downstream `system_analysis` task has sufficient intake context to start.

### System Analysis

Ready when:

- the initiative context and triggering request are already recorded in the initiative issue or equivalent canonical docs;
- business blockers are closed.

Done when:

- the bounded analysis slice has an implementation-ready canonical analysis package;
- contour decomposition exists in `docs/delivery/contour-task-matrix.md`;
- each required `block_delivery` task for that slice exists and records ready and done rules plus canonical inputs;
- each required child implementation, deploy, and e2e task for that slice exists as its own issue;
- dependencies between those tasks are explicit in GitHub;
- any remaining unspecified scope is represented by another planned or linked follow-up `system_analysis` issue with explicit boundaries.

### Block Delivery

Ready when:

- the relevant `system_analysis` task is done;
- the integrated deliverable boundary is explicit;
- all required child implementation issues exist and are linked;
- ready and done rules for integrated validation are recorded.

Done when:

- all required child implementation issues are done;
- integrated validation passes for the block-level outcome;
- follow-up implementation issues are closed or explicitly moved to another block;
- the block task status is `Done`.

### Implementation

Ready when:

- system-analysis outputs are complete for the task's contour;
- the task belongs to exactly one `block_delivery` parent issue;
- all declared dependencies are done;
- the task status is `Ready` or `In Progress`.

Done when:

- the contour-owned change is implemented;
- required repository docs are updated;
- tests or verification owned by that contour are complete;
- downstream dependent tasks can start without guessing;
- the issue is ready for its block parent to move toward `Waiting for Testing` once sibling child issues are also done.

### Deploy

Ready when:

- all implementation tasks needed for the release slice are done;
- deployment prerequisites and runtime requirements are documented.

Done when:

- rollout succeeds in the target environment;
- deployment evidence and environment notes are recorded;
- the e2e task is unblocked.

### E2E

Ready when:

- the target `block_delivery` result is in `Waiting for Testing` or the deployed release slice is ready for integrated validation;
- user scenarios and acceptance criteria are still current.

Done when:

- critical scenarios pass end to end;
- defects are routed back into the affected `block_delivery` task and required child implementation issues when found;
- release recommendation or rejection is recorded.

## Blocking Rules

Stop and mark a task `Blocked` when any of the following is true:

- the task metadata or owner contour is missing or ambiguous;
- the active issue signal is missing, duplicated, or not resolvable by the documented selection order;
- the task depends on unfinished work;
- a role would need to read sibling implementation code just to infer behavior;
- canonical inputs are insufficient for the task type;
- the task improperly mixes multiple owner contours;
- required access to GitHub, environments, or external systems is missing.

Blocker routing rules:

- missing business context -> update the initiative issue or create a linked clarification `system_analysis` task before delivery continues;
- missing specifications, contracts, or decomposition -> block the current implementation issue and create or reopen a linked `system_analysis` follow-up task;
- missing UX behavior, screen states, or design assets -> create or reopen a `system_analysis` task;
- failed rollout prerequisites -> block `deploy` and create follow-up tasks in the owning contour;
- failed integrated validation -> move the relevant `block_delivery` task to `Waiting for Fix`, record defects, and create or reopen follow-up implementation issues for the owning contour of each defect.

## Target Task Flow

Canonical post-setup chain:

1. initial `system_analysis`
2. one or more bounded follow-up `system_analysis` issues
3. `block_delivery`
4. child `implementation` issues by contour
5. block-level validation by `qa-e2e`
6. `deploy` when rollout is required
7. initiative closure after all required blocks are done

## Documentation Update Rules

- Business problem or goals change: update `docs/01-product-vision.md` and `docs/02-business-requirements.md`.
- Scope or acceptance changes: update `docs/03-scope-and-boundaries.md` and `docs/analysis/version-scope-and-acceptance.md`.
- UX behavior changes: update `docs/analysis/ui-specification.md`.
- System design changes: update the relevant files in `docs/analysis/`.
- Repository structure or runtime placement changes: update `docs/05-architecture.md`.
- Workflow, routing, task metadata, or role rules change: update `AGENTS.md`, `.ai-dev-template.workflow-state.json`, issue templates, `instructions/`, and this file together.
- Material decisions change: update `docs/06-decision-log.md`.

## Execution Mode And PR Policy

The repository still uses `.ai-dev-template.config.json` for execution mode, approvals, and PR/review policy.

Those settings control how tasks are executed while task ownership, dependencies, and GitHub Project state remain the routing inputs.
