## Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Purpose | Stage first needed | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

| `VPS_ROOT_USER` | Yes for current VPS access flow | Defines the root SSH user for VPS administrative access | `infrastructure` | Configured in local `.env` and GitHub Secrets |
| `VPS_ROOT_PASSWORD` | Yes for current VPS access flow | Defines the root password used for VPS administrative access | `infrastructure` | Configured in local `.env` and GitHub Secrets |

## Tokens And Secrets

| Secret | Where It Lives | Purpose | Stage first needed | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `gh` auth token | GitHub CLI auth store | Issues and Project automation | `setup` | Validated (`repo`, `project`, `read:org`, `workflow`) |
| `VPS_HOST` | GitHub Actions Secrets | Stage0 VPS deployment target | `infrastructure` | Set on 2026-03-28 |
| `VPS_ROOT_USER` | GitHub Actions Secrets | Stage0 SSH user for VPS automation | `infrastructure` | Set on 2026-03-28 |
| `VPS_ROOT_PASSWORD` | Local `.env` and GitHub Actions Secrets | Administrative VPS access for infrastructure automation | `infrastructure` | Set in GitHub Secrets on 2026-03-28; do not commit the value |
| `ADMIN_TELEGRAM_ID` | GitHub Actions Secrets | Runtime env value required for backend bootstrap | `implementation` | Stage0 baseline value set on 2026-03-28 |
| `DISABLE_TG_AUTH` | GitHub Actions Secrets | Test-env auth bypass flag used in staged env bootstrap | `e2e` | Set on 2026-03-28 |

## GitHub Token Scope Baseline

Required scopes:

- `repo`
- `project`

Recommended scopes:

- `read:org`
- `workflow`

Validation note:

- token scopes are necessary but not sufficient;
- repository membership, project write access, and branch protection rules must still be validated separately;
- record actual validation results in this file during `setup`;
- report setup or later GitHub-side workflow steps complete after the corresponding side effects are verified.

## Runtime And External Integrations

Document every external system that matters to development, deploy, or e2e validation.

| Integration | Purpose | Stage first needed | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GitHub Issues | Workflow task tracking and active-session routing | `setup` | Configured | Seeded issues `#1` and `#2` plus downstream chain `#3-#10` are present |
| GitHub Project | Delivery status board and required workflow fields | `setup` | Configured | Project `expressa` linked to repository with validated custom fields and statuses |
| Telegram customer bot | Launches customer web app and sends customer order-status notifications | `implementation` | Planned | Direct URL access outside Telegram is not supported in v1 |
| Telegram backoffice bot | Launches backoffice web app and sends barista reminders and notifications | `implementation` | Planned | Separate bot from customer-facing access path |
| Telegram WebApp auth | Primary identity and access mechanism in production | `implementation` | Planned | Test environment bypasses Telegram validation with `DISABLE_TG_AUTH=true` |
| VPS host access | Deployment target and runtime environment for test and production flows | `infrastructure` | Validated | Stage0 workflow run `https://github.com/Vitykovskiy/expressa/actions/runs/23677665147` completed deploy and health-check on 2026-03-28 |

## Integration Status

- GitHub repository access: `Validated`
- GitHub Project access: `Validated`
- Deployment environment access: `Validated by Stage0 workflow run 23677665147 and external HTTP 200 check on 2026-03-28`
- E2E environment readiness: `Not ready; waiting for implementation #5, #6, and #7`

## Stage0 Infrastructure Baseline

- Baseline workflow: `.github/workflows/stage0-infrastructure.yml`
- Baseline runtime contract: `docs/delivery/stage0-infrastructure-baseline.md`
- Evidence runs:
  - `https://github.com/Vitykovskiy/expressa/actions/runs/23677665147`
  - `https://github.com/Vitykovskiy/expressa/actions/runs/23677699654`
- Result: `ci-baseline` and `deploy-staging` passed; VPS health-check endpoint returned HTTP 200

## Slice A DevOps Validation Path

- Validation workflow: `.github/workflows/slice-a-devops-validation.yml`
- Runtime contract: `docs/delivery/slice-a-runtime-validation-path.md`
- Runtime manifest: `infra/staging/docker-compose.slice-a.yml`
- Deployment script: `infra/vps/deploy-slice-a-runtime.sh`
- Validation entrypoints: `infra/validation/run-smoke.sh`, `infra/validation/run-e2e.sh`
- CI runtime image for path validation: `traefik/whoami:v1.10.1` (temporary contract image before backend artifact publication)

## Setup Notes

- Update this file as integrations are connected or changed.
- During `setup`, validate GitHub Issues access and GitHub Project access, and record the actual result here.
- Record verification evidence for the GitHub operating model prepared in `setup`, including project readiness, issue creation ability, and required labels or project fields.
- Do not store production secrets in committed files.
- VPS access variables currently live in local `.env`; document variable names in the repository, but never commit secret values.
- If the project uses a separate secret manager, document the reference location here.
