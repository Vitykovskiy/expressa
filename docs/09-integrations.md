## GitHub Token Scope Baseline

Required scopes:

- `repo`
- `project`

Recommended scopes:

- `read:org`
- `workflow`

Validation note:

- token scopes are necessary but not sufficient;
- repository membership, project write access, and branch protection rules must still be validated separately;
- record actual validation results in this file during `setup`;
- report setup or later GitHub-side workflow steps complete after the corresponding side effects are verified.

## Runtime And External Integrations

Document every external system that matters to development, deploy, or e2e validation.

| Integration | Purpose | Stage first needed | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GitHub Issues | Workflow task tracking and active-session routing | `setup` | Configured | Seeded issues `#1` and `#2` plus downstream chain `#3-#21` are present |
| GitHub Project | Delivery status board and required workflow fields | `setup` | Configured | Project `expressa` linked to repository with validated custom fields and statuses |
| Telegram customer bot | Launches customer web app and sends customer order-status notifications | `implementation` | Planned | Direct URL access outside Telegram is not supported in v1 |
| Telegram backoffice bot | Launches backoffice web app and sends barista reminders and notifications | `implementation` | Planned | Separate bot from customer-facing access path |
| Telegram WebApp auth | Primary identity and access mechanism in production | `implementation` | Planned | Test environment bypasses Telegram validation with `DISABLE_TG_AUTH=true` |
| VPS host access | Deployment target and runtime environment for test and production flows | `infrastructure` | Validated | Stage0 workflow run `https://github.com/Vitykovskiy/expressa/actions/runs/23677665147` completed deploy and health-check on 2026-03-28 |

## Setup Notes

- Update this file as integrations are connected or changed.
- During `setup`, validate GitHub Issues access and GitHub Project access, and record the actual result here.
- Record verification evidence for the GitHub operating model prepared in `setup`, including project readiness, issue creation ability, and required labels or project fields.
- Do not store production secrets in committed files.
- VPS access variables currently live in local `.env`; document variable names in the repository, but never commit secret values.
- If the project uses a separate secret manager, document the reference location here.
